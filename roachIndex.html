                        <p> Hello! My name is Anna He and I am currently a sophomore studying Business at the University of Michigan! I am an incoming RA at Mary Markley Hall for the academic year 2019-2020. </p>
                        <p> Right now I am taking the course ALA 421 to prepare myself as an RA. This site will tell you all about my reflections and goals. :)</p>

                        <p> This site was created as an assignment for ALA 421, a class required for all incoming and current RA at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. The assignment states that any website-making tool can be used, whether Google Sites, Wix.com, or Weebly, but I decided to try and code my own from scratch. I have no experience with HTML or CSS but why pass up an opportunity to learn?</p>
                        <p> At the recommendation of my peers, I have also elected to make this site resemble as food blog as much as possible. Thus, have included photos of all sorts of food with every entry. However, please note that I have not taken any of the photos that may exist on this site. All photos belong to their respective owners. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite my best efforts, I certainly cannot match the visual appear of Wix or Google Sites. But for now, here it is. Welcome!</p>
