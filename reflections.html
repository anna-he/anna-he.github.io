                        <p>I like talking about this one. Of course, since my group facilitated it!
                        </p>
                        <p> We opened with ten minutes of self reflection with each person jotting down their personal thoughts and definitions. We then brought it back to the entire group for them to share. Our open discussion thoughts included questions like ‘what does it mean to be an ally and how does that differ from being a bystander. </p>
                        <p> I think we did a good job with the individual self-reflection. When our group met to plan this event, we all agreed that there has been a lot of great discussions, but less self-reflection for ourselves. Our intention with the beginning of the facilitation was to make sure everyone had a chance to think about themselves without feeling the need to have to share their thoughts. </p>

                        <h5> Haenfler: The Cycle of Cynicism </h5>
                        <p> I think this article was really well done. It not only illustrated well how cynicism is cycled, but it also listed very specific reasons for the traps that typically cause it. I admittedly have fallen into these traps, despite my best efforts. </p>
                        <p> I also appreciate how the article mentions the cycle of hope in additional the the cycle of cynicism. So that it is not all negative, it outlines ways to fix the problem shown here. </p>
                        <h5> Transgender 101 </h5>
                        <p> This was a good short dictionary definition. I think it was concise and very informative. I particularly liked the line that said “Many mainstream gay an dlesbian organizations have added the “T” and hold themselves to be LGBT organization, but have done little to nothing to support transgender communities. Don’t just add the “T” without doing the work!” I think that speaks true to not only organisations but perhaps people's attitudes when they think of being an "ally" as well.

                        <h3> Sunday Session: Behind Closed Doors </h3>
                        <p> I really enjoyed moving around and listening to the thoughts of others that are not in our own group. I think we’ve all become very accustomed to each other and speaking our thoughts to each other so speaking to a new group refreshes the idea that we won’t always be talking about these topics to our friends. </p>
                        <p> It also allowed us to also meet other people who were becoming RAs and find out who might be in the same building as us in the future! I also saw some friends that I didn’t know were going to be an RA with me! </p>
                        <p> I also thought it was effective to have a self-led facilitation and discussion at the end. It was spontaneous but that’s also what made it effective: there wasn’t anyone else to facilitate or ask questions. </p>
                        <p> I enjoyed the snacks. I thought those were great hahaha </p>

                        <h5> Johnson:  Getting off the hook: Denial and Resistance </h5>
                        <p> I understand the frustration and I agree that everywhere there is so much denial and resistance to change. Especially change. The reason people do nothing is because even if they don’t deny it, they don’t feel compelled to change themselves and others </p>
                        <p> And to be honest, to not be silent and to put yourself out there for change is a challenging task! A lot of people why away from these topics and don’t want to discuss it because they don’t want to spend the energy. Crafting an opinion on these subjects is a sensitive matter that takes time and thought. Not to mention, even after having crafted these it is easy for others to dismiss you for being "sensitive." For many, it’s much easier to stay silent. </p>
                        </p>
                        <h5> An Open Letter to Non-Black POC </h5>
                        <p> Quote “As non-Black people of color, we are granted the ability to assimilate and reproduce whiteness.” </p>
                        <p> I certainly feel that way when I struggle between my Chinese heritage and my American/Canadian upbringing that it’s either white or bust. There are often jokes made about how buying starbucks is typical “White girl” move… is that what it means to reproduce whiteness? And if so, why is it that this article claims that black people cannot reproduce whiteness? </p>
                        <p> The letter says we need to examine Blackness the same way we examine whiteness but doesn’t that ostracise them from each other further? I acknowledge and appreciate the differences in culture between Black and White communities, but I think both share significant similarities and differences. And this letter to me seems to emphasize differences without much acknowledgement for the areas of grey in between. </p>
                        <p> I of course don’t want to endorse people-of-color-blindness because as a woman of color, I understand through experience how my feelings of ostracisation vary greatly from others. But collectivisation is unavoidable. I think it's part of human nature. That is also how stereotyping occurs. Because unless you take each individual persona separately, you will only find yourself in thinner and thinner groups. What’s more important is knowing that by grouping people together, it does not define them and that smaller differences are there if you look </p>
                        <p> Quote: “It is disingenuous for any of us to say we “sympathize as a fellow minority” as this erases differences and suggests that the University is an equal playing field for all students of color. It is not.”</p>
                        <h5> Husain & Howard: Religious Microaggressions</h5>
                        <p> ahaha this one is especially insightful because I know nothing about religion and I may have had similar thoughts (but to lesser extremes). </p>

                        <h5> How microaggressions are like mosquito bites </h5>
                        <p> Hahaha this is an amusing video. I’m surprised at the negativity in the comments. </p>
                        <p> I think there’s a misconception about microaggressions that make people angry about them. It isn’t about removing microaggressions entirely, awareness about microaggressions is more to do with being sensitive about others feelings to try and mitigate what can and can’t be done </p>
                        <h5> A millennial explains: Why we melt </h5>
                        <p> My take on microagressions: yes they exist. And they will always exist. And it’s impossible to erase them because there’s a lot you don’t know about people and no one knows what might microagress them. </p>
                        <p> Asking where someone is from is not a micro agression. Different questions can take different interpretations. What’s most important is realising that people may be sensitive so some topics and not push too hard for them. Similarly, being aware of microagressions and taking time to reflect on ourselves and why we may hold certian biases that may trigger others, and where these biases come from. </p>
                        <h5> 21 Racial Microaggressions You Hear on a Daily Basis </h5>
                        <p> Some of these questions are innocent. But the context and the phrasing is not thoughtful. To ask someone whether or not they speak Spanish could be extrapolated from their education, not necessarily how they look. Especially if you know that they come from an ethnic background that does speak Spanish. There is a fine line between making assumptions and getting to know someone new. </p>
                        <h5> Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Implications for Clinical Practice</h5>
                        <p> Not all of these microagressions carry the message associated in the chart. Asking where someone is from is not necessarily implying that they are foreign or not American. It could just as much be about learning more about someone’s past. </p>
                        <p> Being told I’m articulate does not have to be a comparison against my race. It depends on intentions. In fact, becoming more articulate is one of my goals. Does that mean I see myself to be unintelligent for my race? </p>
                        <p> Quote: “I believe the most qualified person should get the job” I don’t think that’s wrong. There are a lot of assumptions that must be made to move from the microaggression to the message. </p>

                        <p> I really enjoyed the keywords at the beginning of the article as well as Figure 1. </p>

                        <p> I thought this really showed how poverty perpetuates more poverty. This also reminded me of in high school when we learned about an aboriginal community in Northern Ontario that was highly impoverished and not well educated. But they were stuck in such a cycle with poor infrastructure and a lack of resources to improve their standard of living, or even to leave their location </p>
                        <p> The result was higher suicide and drug abuse rates even in children and adolescents. I think this article </p>
