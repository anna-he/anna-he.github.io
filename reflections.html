                    <h3> Testimonial </h3>
 
                    <p> A. </p>
                    <p> The letter A embodies a lot of who I am. </p>
                    <p> My name and legal identity, is Anna. It starts with an A. And ends with an A. </p>
                    <p> I was born and now reside in Ann Arbor, a place often Abbreviated to AA or A squared. </p>
                    <p> I grew up in Canada. A country that may not start with an A but A’s fill half its letters. </p>
                    <p> The letter A has identified me in all sorts of ways. Some of these identities are Apparent, others are not. </p>
                    <p> Let’s start with the obvious: I am Asian. With immigrant parents from China. Being Asian has shaped my values. I value Achievement that can be measured Absolutely. My parents’ struggled to America with nothing but promises to be good students. For them, Academics led them to the greeable life that I have today. From them, I inherited an Ambition to be Above Average. To Achieve straight-As and prove my Astuteness to the world. This Affects my everyday decisions: managing my priorities and how I Allot my Available time. Those who don’t Agree may call me square, or boring, or a tryhard or a nerd. But I am not Apologetic for focusing on what is important to me. Others may Accuse me of Appearing Aloof or Arrogant, but ironically, my Aim is to remain humble. </p>
                    <p> My Agent identity is less Appreciable. I am Able. I was born All-right and have never sustained heavy injuries. Being Able has not directly shaped me into myself today, but it has given me the opportunity to be shaped by other events. Being Able has Allowed me to Amuse myself with sports, music, and all sorts of Activities without problem. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to climb Across the monkey bars a feisty seven-year-old. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to hear the notes of my piano performance come Alive during my middle school recital. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to grow in to the person I am today. I may not been socialised by my Ability itself, but it has Allowed me to enjoy an Abundance of critical occasions. And as such, my Ability is as important as any other social identity. </p>
                    <p> There is an Assortment of A-letter words to Articulate myself and my several social identities. But it is not necessary to dissect them all Apart. After all, the most important identity is one where they all Assemble to be me. I Am Anna.</p>
                    <p> A-N-N-A. </p>
