                       <p> When I wrote about my story on the worksheet 1) I struggled and had to reflect a lot and 2) I thought that what I had wrote made a lot of sense. </p>
                       <p> However, when it came time to say it out loud, I was a lot more self conscious of how I would come off and how others would portray my experience. </p>
                       <p> My own facilitation story reflected a time of my own ignorance of a certain identity and how I facilitated a conversation with a friend to educate myself. Especially since my friend was a resource with a lot of opinions and knowledge about this particular topic. </p>
                       <p> However, in my group, there was a person of the very identity I was admitting my ignorance about. This made me feel a lot more vulnerable when I spoke. Nevertheless, I think it was a great experience because it made me more aware of what I said and the context of it. When we’re reflecting on our own, it’s easy to forget about the audience you are bringing your story to. I think that was a meaningful insight into this exercise. </p>
