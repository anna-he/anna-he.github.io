        			<p> Hello! My name is Anna He and I am currently a sophomore studying Business at the University of Michigan!</p>
       				<p> I am an incoming RA at Mary Markley Hall for the academic year 2019-2020. </p>
       				<p> Right now I am taking the course ALA 421 to prepare myself as an RA. This site will tell you all about my reflections and goals.</p>

                    <h3>About This Site</h3>   
                    <p> This site was created as an assignment for ALA 421, a class required for all incoming and current RA at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. The assignment states that any website-making tool can be used, whether Google Sites, Wix.com, or Weebly, but I decided to try and code my own from scratch. I have no experience with HTML or CSS but why pass up an opportunity to learn?</p>
                    <p>Despite my best efforts, I certainly cannot match the visual appear of Wix or Google Sites. But for now, here it is. Welcome!</p>
