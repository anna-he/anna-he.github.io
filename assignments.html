                    <h3> Partner Reflection </h3>

                    <p> Meeting up with my partner was not difficult. I think finding commonalities is what made it both easy and genuine. My experience is that if I struggle to find a topic in common with an individual, the equations may feel forced or difficult. The commonalities do not have to be big. They can be subtle things. </p>
                    <p>  With my partner, there were a lot of default topics that we already shared. We both attend U-M as undergrad students. We are both in this ALA class, and we both live in Michigan and recently survived a polar vortex. But it was easy to look at each other and realise from the colour of skin that we had more in common. </p>
                    <p> One that we spoke of immediately was our ethnicity and race. I learned that my partner is from Taiwan. We were both born in the U.S. but came from East Asian countries. Not to mention an extremely similar East Asian countries that both speak Mandarin Chinese and have similar cultures and traditions. Identifying our common ethnic heritage immediately made the interaction more comfortable. Moreover, we bonded over events that were not necessarily explicitly specific to our culture. Instead, we talked about a Facebook Group we had both joined titled “Subtle Asian Traits.” </p>
                    <p> Overall, this experience emphasized the importance of finding a common topic with whomever you are talking about. There will be residents who do not have a similar heritage and background as me. </p>
