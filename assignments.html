                        <p> This assignment I completed with Yvonne and Jacob. We all chose this topic because it was a topic we were unfamiliar with and wanted to learn more about. We met up in person to discuss our plans. Because the faciliation was thirty minutes in total, we felt that it would be appropriate for </p>

                        <p> Meeting up with my partner was not difficult. I think finding commonalities is what made it both easy and genuine. My experience is that if I struggle to find a topic in common with an individual, the equations may feel forced or difficult. The commonalities do not have to be big. They can be subtle things. </p>
                        <p>  With my partner, there were a lot of default topics that we already shared. We both attend U-M as undergrad students. We are both in this ALA class, and we both live in Michigan and recently survived a polar vortex. But it was easy to look at each other and realise from the colour of skin that we had more in common. </p>
                        <p> One that we spoke of immediately was our ethnicity and race. I learned that my partner is from Taiwan. We were both born in the U.S. but came from East Asian countries. Not to mention an extremely similar East Asian countries that both speak Mandarin Chinese and have similar cultures and traditions. Identifying our common ethnic heritage immediately made the interaction more comfortable. Moreover, we bonded over events that were not necessarily explicitly specific to our culture. Instead, we talked about a Facebook Group we had both joined titled “Subtle Asian Traits.” </p>
                        <p> Overall, this experience emphasized the importance of finding a common topic with whomever you are talking about. There will be residents who do not have a similar heritage and background as me. </p>

                        <p> Recently I wrote a testimonial about my social identities and how they have shaped me. Now I want to reflect on the entire process, including writing the testimonial, presenting it in front of others, and reading the affirmations that my peers wrote for me. </p>
                        <p> When I wrote my testimonial, I started off unsure, but soon became confident in the words I was putting on the page. I liked my word choices, and the way I was using the letter A. I thought I was expressing my identities well. One other person took a look at my paper before I printed it out and tucked in my bag for that Sunday. </p>
                        <p> On Sunday, I felt ready. I took out my single sheet of single-sided paper in size 14 font. And then I saw other people with three or four sheet of paper, double sided, size 1.3 font. It was a little nerve-wracking but being chosen to go second reassured me a little. As expected, what I had prepared was nothing at all like what the person before me said. But I read mine confidently, and felt good about it when I finished. As the other classmates read theirs, I realised it didn’t matter that mine was shorter, or scripted, or different from anyone else. After all, the was to reflect ourselves as different individuals. There are lots of reasons for us to be both similar and the same. </p>
                        <p> Writing the affirmations during the session were great. I loved customizing the messages to each classmate. And receiving the affirmations and reading over them was much more rewarding than I had thought it would be. I’m glad I took the opportunity to show how I had been an active listener during the discussion. </p>
                        <p>I hope everyone else also felt the same way. Thank you all! :)</p>

                        <p> A. </p>
                        <p> The letter A embodies a lot of who I am. </p>
                        <p> My name and legal identity, is Anna. It starts with an A. And ends with an A. </p>
                        <p> I was born and now reside in Ann Arbor, a place often Abbreviated to AA or A squared. </p>
                        <p> I grew up in Canada. A country that may not start with an A but A’s fill half its letters. </p>
                        <p> The letter A has identified me in all sorts of ways. Some of these identities are Apparent, others are not. </p>
                        <p> Let’s start with the obvious: I am Asian. With immigrant parents from China. Being Asian has shaped my values. I value Achievement that can be measured Absolutely. My parents’ struggled to America with nothing but promises to be good students. For them, Academics led them to the greeable life that I have today. From them, I inherited an Ambition to be Above Average. To Achieve straight-As and prove my Astuteness to the world. This Affects my everyday decisions: managing my priorities and how I Allot my Available time. Those who don’t Agree may call me square, or boring, or a tryhard or a nerd. But I am not Apologetic for focusing on what is important to me. Others may Accuse me of Appearing Aloof or Arrogant, but ironically, my Aim is to remain humble. </p>
                        <p> My Agent identity is less Appreciable. I am Able. I was born All-right and have never sustained heavy injuries. Being Able has not directly shaped me into myself today, but it has given me the opportunity to be shaped by other events. Being Able has Allowed me to Amuse myself with sports, music, and all sorts of Activities without problem. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to climb Across the monkey bars a feisty seven-year-old. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to hear the notes of my piano performance come Alive during my middle school recital. Without my Ability, I may not have been able to grow in to the person I am today. I may not been socialised by my Ability itself, but it has Allowed me to enjoy an Abundance of critical occasions. And as such, my Ability is as important as any other social identity. </p>
                        <p> There is an Assortment of A-letter words to Articulate myself and my several social identities. But it is not necessary to dissect them all Apart. After all, the most important identity is one where they all Assemble to be me. I Am Anna.</p>
                        <p> A-N-N-A. </p>
